I have had a love for the
sciences since I was a child. I found my love for philosophy in
college and quickly switched my major from Mechanical Engineering
Technology to Philosophy; you can imagine how <i>excited</i> my
parents were! I have always had an ever-rotating array of hobbies
from extreme sports to basic electronics/programming. One of the
few hobbies that has stayed completely persistent in my life
is my love for music: playing, composing, and listening. The
upright bass is my instrument of choice which has encouraged a
love for classical music. From riding bmx bikes to hacking around
with computers, I always love to present myself with a challenge.
